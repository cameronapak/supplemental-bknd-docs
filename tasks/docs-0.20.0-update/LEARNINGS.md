## Task 19.0: License Update - Apache 2.0

### What I learned:
- Bknd is licensed under Apache-2.0 license (verified from GitHub repo)
- Apache-2.0 is permissive license allowing commercial use, modification, and distribution
- When updating docs for license changes, update both README.md (description + dedicated section) and docs/index.md (Official Resources section)
- License information should be prominent in documentation repositories to set clear expectations for users
- Always verify license from official sources (GitHub LICENSE.md file, not just assumptions)
