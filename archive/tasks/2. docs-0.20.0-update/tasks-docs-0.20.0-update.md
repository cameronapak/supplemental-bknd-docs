### Notes
- **Critical Blocker:** Must fetch bknd source code before any verification tasks can begin
- Use `npx opensrc bknd-io/bknd` to fetch the official source code
- Import verification requires checking actual file structure in `opensrc/repos/github.com/bknd-io/bknd/`
- Link verification: Use `grep -r "\[.*\](.*\)" docs/` for internal links and web tools for external
- Code verification: Compare import statements with actual exports in package.json and source files
- Consistency checks: Use `grep -r "adminOptions\|adminBasepath" docs/` to find all instances
- Terminology: Check source code for correct API naming before making changes
- Simplification principles: Remove redundancy, eliminate edge cases, consolidate duplicate content, use concise examples
- After each task is completed, update the task list by checking off `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
- Track progress after each phase, not just after parent tasks
- Original alignment score was 37.25% (MEDIUM), target >80% after all fixes

## Instructions for Completing Tasks

**IMPORTANT:** As you complete each task, you must check it off in this markdown file by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]`. This helps track progress and ensures you don't skip any steps.

Example:
- `- [ ] 1.1 Read file` → `- [x] 1.1 Read file` (after completing)

Update the file after completing each sub-task, not just after completing an entire parent task.
