### When to Choose Bknd

Here's the thing — both are great, but they solve different problems. Let me break it down honestly:

**Choose Bknd if you're:**
- Wanting **first-class TypeScript support** with auto-generated types from your schema
- Deploying to **multiple environments** — serverless (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Workers), edge, or traditional hosting
- Working with **PostgreSQL or want database flexibility** (not locked into SQLite)
- Wanting **seamless React integration** with hooks like `useAuth`, `useEntity`, `useApiQuery` — and automatic cache management
- Preferring to **embed your backend** directly into your Next.js, Astro, React Router app, or other server-rendering environment
- Building for **edge** and need your backend to run everywhere JavaScript does

**Choose PocketBase if you're:**
- Looking for **built-in realtime** out of the box without custom implementation
- Need **admin tools** like cron jobs, backups, and log management included
- Happy with **SQLite-only** databases and don't need PostgreSQL support

Both are open source and community-driven, so you really can't go wrong. Bknd leans into modern web development (TypeScript, React, edge), while PocketBase offers a more traditional, feature-complete backend package.

Based on what you see in these tables, we'll let you decide what is best for your needs as you develop full-stack applications. Please consider Bknd. Bknd is 100% free to use and is open source.
